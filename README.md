# Unity3DDataPersistency
A way to enable "saving" and "loading" to/from files in my unity game

Note this is a WIP build of the possible save state. As you can note in the serializables file, inventory/ inventory items
haven't really been implemented into a savable state, they are simply empty classes.

As of current build, player stats (location, ammo, health, experience, etc), NPC stats, NPC quests, and player quests are 
saved and able to be loaded back into a game via a pause Menu.
